# Spyder-Machine-Learning-Project

Senior thesis project utilizing various regression algorithms to identify the biggest impactors in student academic performance

The purpose of this project is to use the Student Performance dataset found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository to identify or predict what various lifestyle characteristics are the biggest impactors or identifiers of student academic performance. This dataset contains 33 attributes and 359/649 instances for a given Math and Portuguese class, respectively. Some of the attributes recorded correspond to characteristics such as: the student's weekly and weekend alcohol consumption, their mother and father's occupations, their individual travel times from where they live to the school they attend, and so on. As of now, you will find three separate regression algorithms used to make these identifications; a Multiple Linear Regression model, a Support Vector Regression Model, and an Artifical Neural Network, all of which pertain specifically to the math scores dataset. There will also be visualizations of predictive ability and accumulated error for each model.

*Note: This project is still currently being developed until May 2022. Therefore, more additions to the repository will be made over time, including rebuilt models focused on utilizing the Portuguese dataset.*
