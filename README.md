# Spyder-Machine-Learning-Project
Used as my senior thesis, the goal of this project was to determine if a consistent correlation exists between the lifestyle characteristics of students and their overall class performances. Encapsulated in this project is the dataset used and three separate machine learning models for regression: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR).
